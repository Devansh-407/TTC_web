            It all started in 2016 when our founder, Sarah Martinez, created a handcrafted memory album for her parents' 40th wedding anniversary. What began as a personal project to capture their love story quickly became something more—a realization that every family has precious moments worth preserving in a beautiful, meaningful way.

            That first album, filled with carefully selected photos, handwritten notes, and personal touches, moved her parents to tears. Friends and family who saw it began asking Sarah to create similar keepsakes for their own special occasions. Word spread, and what started as a passion project in her small apartment studio grew into The Tohfa Creations.
